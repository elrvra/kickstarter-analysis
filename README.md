# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 Louise is a playwright looking to start her own fundraising campaign to help fund her play “Fever”. Being a little reluctant and despite her budget of over $10K, Louise first seeks out analytical expertise to pin point specific reasons a campaign’s outcome would be successful. For the initial analysis to Louise, some important observations were made. First, while there are a total of 4144 Kickstarter campaigns across 19 countries, the theater category is the most popular at 1393 campaigns. The theater category is also the most successful at 839 out of 2185 successful outcomes (exhibit A). The play subcategory follows a similar trend; out of three subcategories (i.e. musical, plays, spaces), plays are in lead with a total ot 1066 campaigns compared to 187 for spaces and 140 for musicals. As like the theater category, the plays subcategory also has the highest number of successful campaigns at 694 out of 839 (exhibit B).

 When analyzing the outcomes based on launch date for all campaigns categories, there was a spike of successful campaigns that began in May and then tapered off by the end of the year (exhibit C). By comparison, the technology campaigns reveals a different story. Instead of one large spike, their trend lines are all over the place (exhibit D). Furthermore, when creating an area chart of play outcomes based on active days, there is another large spike, reflecting a whopping 239 successful play campaigns which run for 30 days (exhibit E).

 In conclusion, it seems that Louise will have luck her side given that the fundraising campaign she would spearhead is in a parent and subcategory that is not only popular, but highly suceesful compared to others. It is also important to note that May a good time for Louise to begin her campaign, but she has to keep in mind that the length of a campaign is correlated with its success. 
 
 Now, in order to further her understanding of the campaign arena, Louise would like to see how other campaigns compare to one another, by looking specificcally at their launch dates and their funding outcomes which can be summarizedd in the following body of this file. 

### Purpose
 The purpose of this project is to deliver an analysis of Kickstarter Campaign data by use of pivots, graphs, and formulas to display pertinent details that will help Louise plan her campaign timeline as well as gauge the goal ranges needed in order to be successful in her campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When creating a line chart to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When creating a line chart to visualize the relationship between percentage of outcomes and goal amount ranges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges encountered, was interpreting the data into a meaningful analysis that tells the story of what is happening with the numbers. It is easy to get lost in the numbers and over analyze every detail assuming everything is pertinent to the story, but this was overcome by me understanding the goal and purpose of the story, and then then me asking questions to point my focus on where I need to analyze and compare to achieve it (e.g., is there a time plays are more successful during the year, how long are campaigns active for, what is the success rate for plays, what is the average donation for successful plays).

Another challenge I encountered was understanding the chart information. For me, its easier to look at numbers on a screen and decipher what is high or low, what period is significant or not, etc. Playing around with the different chart options help me overcome this challenge and better enable me understand what is happening and what chart best expresses the data clearly from an analytical standpoint and so that it is in line with the feedback I need to provide to achieve the goal and purpose of the research. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Successful theater outcomes peaked in the months of February, May, and October so this may be a good time to start a campaign in this category
2. Successful theater outcomes and failed theater outcomes are nearly the same in the month of December so it seems this is not a good time to start a campaign in this category

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Plays with a goal amount of <$5000, have the highest percentage of successful outcomes so it may be good to review goal amount ranges before seeking funding

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The dataset does how long successful theater outcomes are active for, which seems to be a contributing factor
2. The dataset is not by year, which could alter the highs/lows of the data points as well as the and goal amount ranges for a successful campaign

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Average donation by month of successful play outcomes 
2. Active days (i.e. launch date minus start date) of successful play outcomes
3. Amount of backers by country of successful play outcomes
4. A clustered column chart can be used in stead of a line chart for theater outcomes by launch date
5. An area chart can be used instead of a line chart for outcomes based on goals
