# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright looking to start her own fundraising campaign to help fund her play “Fever”. Being a little reluctant and despite her budget of over $10K, Louise is first seeking out analytical expertise to pin point specific reasons a campaign project’s outcome would be successful.
